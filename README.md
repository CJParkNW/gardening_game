# Point-and-Click Gardening Game

First Python project from Intro Comp Sci Class in Fall 2020.

# Virtual Garden

The game, Virtual Garden, is a simple and short simulation of a garden where you can grow fruits, vegetables, and flowers while learning a few fun facts. The activities used are sowing seeds, watering the garden, and pest control.

All graphics were created by Catherine Park. Inspiration for the graphics came from the Nintendo DS game Gardening Mama and other 8-Bit Games.
